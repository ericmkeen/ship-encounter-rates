# Whale-ship encounter rate

A simulation-based tool to build distributions of whale-vessel encounter rates.  

To get started, read this [vignette](https://github.com/ericmkeen/ship-encounter-rates/blob/main/R/demo.pdf).  

This analytical tool was developed as part of the project on **Ships, Whales, and Acoustics in Gitga'at territory (SWAG)**, a collaboration between the Gitga'at First Nation, North Coast Cetacean Society [(www.bcwhales.org)](www.bcwhales.org) and WWF-Canada.  

Code was developed by Eric Keen on behalf of SWAG.
